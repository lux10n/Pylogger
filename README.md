# Pylogger
Just a simple keylogger in python

## Special thanks
Thanks to @mrVaro for the idea and the code

## How it works
1. launches a listener in the background
2. listens for keystrokes
3. saves the keystrokes in keylog.txt

## What to do ?
- add a server to remotely record keystrokes (done, see [here]([https://github.com/mrVaro](https://github.com/mrVaro/keylogger-server)))
- obfuscate code so that it avoids Windows Defender
